# QuadCraft Block System

This document describes the tetrahedral block system that forms the foundation of QuadCraft, detailing the properties, behaviors, and interactions of tetrahedral blocks.

## Overview

Unlike traditional voxel games that use cubic blocks, QuadCraft builds its world from tetrahedral blocks. This fundamental difference creates unique gameplay mechanics, building possibilities, and challenges.

## Tetrahedral Block Fundamentals

### Tetrahedral Geometry

Each block in QuadCraft is a regular tetrahedron, a polyhedron with four triangular faces, six edges, and four vertices:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Tetrahedral Block Geometry"
        Structure["Tetrahedral Structure"]
        Connectivity["Block Connectivity"]
        Orientation["Block Orientation"]
    end
    
    Structure --> Faces["4 Triangular Faces"]
    Structure --> Edges["6 Edges"]
    Structure --> Vertices["4 Vertices"]
    
    Connectivity --> FaceConnections["Face-to-Face Connections"]
    Connectivity --> EdgeConnections["Edge-to-Edge Connections"]
    Connectivity --> VertexConnections["Vertex-to-Vertex Connections"]
    
    Orientation --> FourPossibleOrientations["Four Possible Orientations"]
    Orientation --> RotationalSymmetry["Rotational Symmetry"]
```

Key geometric properties:

- **Space-Filling**: Tetrahedra can fill 3D space when properly arranged
- **Dihedral Angle**: Approximately 70.53Â° between faces

### Coordinate System

Tetrahedral blocks use Quadray coordinates for positioning:

```mermaid

        Cartesian["Cartesian Coordinates (x,y,z)"]
        Quadray["Quadray Coordinates (a,b,c,d)"]
