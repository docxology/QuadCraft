# QuadCraft Gameplay Overview

## Core Concept

QuadCraft is a voxel-based game that reimagines the traditional cubic voxel paradigm by using tetrahedral elements as its fundamental building blocks. This unique approach creates distinct gameplay experiences centered around exploration, building, and navigation in a tetrahedral world.
