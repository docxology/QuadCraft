# Advanced Building Techniques

Building in QuadCraft's tetrahedral world requires a shift in thinking from traditional cubic voxel games. This guide covers advanced techniques for creating stable, aesthetically pleasing, and functional structures in a non-Euclidean space.

## Tetrahedral Geometry Principles

### Slopes and Angles

Unlike cubes, tetrahedrons naturally form 60-degree slopes. This means:

- **Natural Pyramids**: Stacking blocks creates perfect pyramids without stepping.
- **Diagonal Walls**: Walls naturally lean or zigzag depending on orientation.
- **Arches**: Creating arches requires alternating block orientations (Type Z and Type C).

### Structural Integrity

Tetrahedral structures have unique load-bearing properties:

- **Triangular Bases**: The most stable foundation is a triangle, not a square.
- **Interlocking**: Blocks naturally interlock, providing higher stability than gravity-defying cubic stacks.

## Building Patterns

### The Helix

A spiral staircase can be formed by placing blocks in a continuous 60-degree rotation.

1. Place a base block.
2. Place the next block on a side face, rotated 60 degrees.
3. Repeat to create a smooth, natural spiral.

### The Geodesic Dome

Approximating a sphere is easier in QuadCraft's geometry.

- Start with a central point (Octahedron space).
- Build outward in all 4 primary quadray directions.
- Connect the tips to form a rough sphere (geodesic dome).

### Smooth Tunnels

Tunneling follows the quadray axes (a, b, c, d).

- **Straight Tunnels**: Follow a single axis (e.g., +a).
- **Zig-Zag Tunnels**: Alternate between two axes (e.g., +a, +b) to create a wider, traversable path.

## Material Usage

| Material | Best Use | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Stone** | Foundations, Castles | High durability, structural look. |
| **Wood** | Flooring, Furniture | (If available via mods) Warm aesthetic. |
| **Glass** | Windows, Skylights | Transparent, lets light through. |
| **Water** | Pools, Moats | Fills tetrahedral voids naturally. |

## Tips for Master Builders

1. **Think in Triangles**: Sketch your floor plans using triangles, not squares.
2. **Use the Grid**: Toggle the Quadray Grid overlay (F2) to see buildable nodes.
3. **Symmetry**: Tetrahedral symmetry is 4-fold, not 6-fold like cubes. Rotate your view often.
