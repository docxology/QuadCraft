# Experiments - AI Agent Guidelines

## Purpose

Experimental space for rapid prototyping and exploration.

## Guidelines

### Exploration vs Production

- Experiments: Quick tests, may be messy
- Production: Goes to `browser/` modular version

### Documentation

- Add comment header explaining purpose
- Note what worked and what didn't
- Screenshot interesting results

### Cleanup

- Archive successful experiments
- Delete clearly obsolete ones
- Keep experiments that demonstrate concepts

## When to Create New Experiment

- Testing new algorithm
- Exploring visual approach
- Prototyping feature before integration

## When to Integrate

Move to production when:

- Algorithm proven
- Code is clean
- Feature is stable
- Tests pass
