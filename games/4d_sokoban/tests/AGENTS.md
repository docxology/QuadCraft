# 4D Sokoban Tests — Regression maintenance

[README.md](README.md) lists the actual Node entrypoints, source-covered behaviors and browser-runner limits. Run documented commands from the QuadCraft repository root, not a guessed launcher-relative working directory.

Do not infer canonical adjacency from `BaseBoard` inheritance or shared direction names. Preserve the actual direct-offset rule and explicitly distinguish random generation from a solvability guarantee.

Keep regressions tied to observable state transitions and the real board/controller boundary. Numeric pass totals or imported shared helpers are not coverage claims; report command results only when executed. Browser dependency lists and Canvas behavior require separate browser evidence. Read the [game guide](../README.md) before changing scenarios.
