# 4D Mahjong Tests — Regression maintenance

[README.md](README.md) lists the actual Node entrypoints, source-covered behaviors and browser-runner limits. Run documented commands from the QuadCraft repository root, not a guessed launcher-relative working directory.

Keep logical layer ordering separate from camera depth and exposure. Do not replace array tile identity with normalized occupancy keys.

Keep regressions tied to observable state transitions and the real board/controller boundary. Numeric pass totals or imported shared helpers are not coverage claims; report command results only when executed. Browser dependency lists and Canvas behavior require separate browser evidence. Read the [game guide](../README.md) before changing scenarios.
